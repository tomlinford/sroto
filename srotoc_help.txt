Usage: srotoc [OPTIONS] [JSONNET_FILES] [NICKEL_FILES] [PROTO_FILES]
`srotoc` is a light wrapper around `protoc` and can be used as a drop-in
replacement.  If JSONNET_FILES or NICKEL_FILES are provided, it will first
parse the files and generate protobuf source files.  Any protobuf source files
as well as the initial PROTO_FILES specified will then be passed into a `protoc`
call.  Note that JSONNET_FILES must be suffixed with `.jsonnet`, NICKEL_FILES
must be suffixed with `.ncl`, and PROTO_FILES must be suffixed with `.proto`.

These options are specific to the jsonnet/nickel -> protobuf conversion:
  -JJPATH, --jpath=JPATH      Specify additional directories in which to
                              search for jsonnet imports.  May be specified
                              multiple times; directories will be searched in
                              order.  Note that in jsonnet, imports are first
                              attempted to be resolved relative to the file
                              performing the import.
  --proto_out=OUT_DIR         Generate Protobuf source files.  Must be
                              specified if any jsonnet or nickel files are
                              provided.

The remaining options are transparently passed to `protoc`:
