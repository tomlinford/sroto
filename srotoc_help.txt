Usage: srotoc [OPTIONS] [JSONNET_FILES] [PROTO_FILES]
`srotoc` is a light wrapper around `protoc` and can be used as a drop-in
replacement.  If JSONNET_FILES are provided, it will first parse the files
and generate protobuf source files.  Any protobuf source files as well as the
initial PROTO_FILES specified will then be passed into a `protoc` call.  Note
that JSONNET_FILES must be suffixed with `.jsonnet` and PROTO_FILES must be
suffixed with `.proto`. 

These options are specific to the jsonnet -> protobuf conversion:
  -JJPATH, --jpath=JPATH      Specify additional directories in which to
                              search for jsonnet imports.  May be specified
                              multiple times; directories will be searched in
                              order.  Note that in jsonnet, imports are first
                              attempted to be resolved relative to the file
                              performing the import.
  --proto_out=OUT_DIR         Generate Protobuf source files.  Must be
                              specified if any jsonnet files are provided.

The remaining options are transparently passed to `protoc`:
